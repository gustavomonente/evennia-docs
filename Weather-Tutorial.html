    <p>This tutorial will have us create a simple weather system for our MUD.  The way we want to use this is to have all outdoor rooms echo weather-related messages to the room at regular and semi-random intervals. Things like "Clouds gather above", "It starts to rain" and so on. </p>
<p>One could imagine every outdoor room in the game having a script running on themselves that fires regularly. For this particular example it is however more efficient to do it another way, namely by using a "ticker-subscription" model. The principle is simple: Instead of having each Object individually track the time, they instead subscribe to be called by a global ticker who handles time keeping.  Not only does this centralize and organize much of the code in one place, it also has less computing overhead. </p>
<p>Evennia offers the <a href="TickerHandler.html">TickerHandler</a> specifically for using the subscription model. We will use it for our weather system. </p>
<p>We will assume you know how to make your own Typeclasses. If not see one of the beginning tutorials. We will create a new WeatherRoom typeclass that is aware of the day-night cycle.</p>
<pre><code class="python">
    import random
    from evennia import DefaultRoom, TICKER_HANDLER

    ECHOES = [&quot;The sky is clear.&quot;, 
              &quot;Clouds gather overhead.&quot;,
              &quot;It's starting to drizzle.&quot;,
              &quot;A breeze of wind is felt.&quot;,
              &quot;The wind is picking up&quot;] # etc  

    class WeatherRoom(DefaultRoom):
        &quot;This room is ticked at regular intervals&quot;        

        def at_object_creation(self):
            &quot;called only when the object is first created&quot;
            TICKER_HANDLER.add(60 * 60, self.at_weather_update)

        def at_weather_update(self, *args, **kwargs):
            &quot;ticked at regular intervals&quot;
            echo = random.choice(ECHOES)
            self.msg_contents(echo)
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>at_object_creation</code> method, we simply added ourselves to the TickerHandler and tell it to call <code>at_weather_update</code> every hour (<code>60*60</code> seconds). During testing you might want to play with a shorter time duration.</p>
<p>For this to work we also create a custom hook <code>at_weather_update(*args, **kwargs)</code>, which is the call sign required by TickerHandler hooks.</p>
<p>Henceforth the room will inform everyone inside it when the weather changes. This particular example is of course very simplistic - the weather echoes are just randomly chosen and don't care what weather came before it. Expanding it to be more realistic is a useful exercise. </p>
