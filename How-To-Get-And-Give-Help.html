<p>If you cannot find what you are looking for in the <a href="index.html">online documentation</a>, here's what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think the documentation is not clear enough and are short on time, fill in our quick little <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dGN0VlJXMWpCT3VHaHpscDEzY1RoZGc6MQ#gid=0">online form</a> and let us know - no login required. Maybe the docs need to be improved or a new tutorial added! Note that while this form is useful as a suggestion box we cannot answer questions or reply to you. Use the discussion group or chat (linked below) if you want feedback.</li>
<li>If you have trouble with a missing feature or a problem you think is a bug, go to the <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues">issue tracker</a> and search to see if has been reported/suggested already. If you can't find an existing entry create a new one.</li>
<li>If you need help, want to start a discussion or get some input on something you are working on, make a post to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/evennia/">discussions group</a> This is technically a 'mailing list', but you don't need to use e-mail; you can post and read all messages just as easily from your browser via the online interface.</li>
<li>If you want more direct discussions with developers and other users, consider dropping into our IRC chat channel <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=evennia">#evennia</a> on the <em>Freenode</em> network. Please note however that you have to be patient if you don't get any response immediately; we are all in very different time zones and many have busy personal lives. So you might have to hang around for a while - you'll get noticed eventually!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-give-help">How to <em>give</em> Help<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-give-help" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Evennia is a completely non-funded project. It relies on the time donated by its users and developers in order to progress. </p>
<p>The first and easiest way you as a user can help us out is by taking part in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/evennia/">community discussions</a> and by giving feedback on what is good or bad. Report bugs you find and features you lack to our <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues">issue tracker</a>. Just the simple act of letting developers know you are out there using their program is worth a lot. Generally mentioning and reviewing Evennia elsewhere is also a nice way to spread the word. </p>
<p>If you'd like to help develop Evennia more hands-on, here are some ways to get going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look through our <a href="index.html">online documentation wiki</a> and see if you can help improve or expand the documentation (even small things like fixing typos!). You don't need any particular permissions to edit the wiki.</li>
<li>Send a message to our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/evennia/">discussion group</a> and/or our <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=evennia">IRC chat</a> asking about what needs doing, along with what your interests and skills are.</li>
<li>Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues">issue tracker</a> and see if there's something you feel like taking on. <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abug%20label%3Amaster-branch">here are bugs</a> that need fixes. At any given time there may also be some <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/labels/bounty">bounties</a> open - these are issues members of the community has put up money to see fixed (if you want to put up a bounty yourself you can do so via our page on <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/teams/evennia">bountysource</a>).</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="Contributing.html">Contributing</a> page on how to practically contribute with code using github.</li>
</ul>
<p>... And finally, if you want to help motivate and support development you can also drop some coins in the developer's cup. You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/se/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=Z-VlOvfGjYq2qvCDOUGpb6C8Due7skT0qOklQEy5EbaD1f0eyEQaYlmCc8O&amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d64ad11bbf4d2a5a1a0d303a50933f9b2">make a donation via PayPal</a> or, even better, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/griatch">become an Evennia patron on Patreon</a>! This is a great way to tip your hat and show that you appreciate the work done with the server! Finally, if you want to encourage the community to resolve a particular </p>
