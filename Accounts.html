    <p>All <em>users</em> (real people) that starts a game <a href="Sessions.html">Session</a> on Evennia are doing so through an
object called <em>Account</em>. The Account object has no in-game representation, it represents a unique
game account.  In order to actually get on the game the Account must <em>puppet</em> an <a href="Objects.html">Object</a>
(normally a <a href="Objects#Character">Character</a>). </p>
<p>Exactly how many Sessions can interact with an Account and its Puppets at once is determined by
Evennia's <a href="Sessions#Multisession-mode">MULTISESSION_MODE</a> setting.</p>
<p>Apart from storing login information and other account-specific data, the Account object is what is
chatting on <a href="Communications.html">Channels</a>.  It is also a good place to store <a href="Locks.html">Permissions</a> to be
consistent between different in-game characters as well as configuration options.  The Account
object also has its own <a href="Command-Sets.html">CmdSet</a>, the <code>AccountCmdSet</code>. </p>
<p>Logged into default evennia, you can use the <code>ooc</code> command to leave your current
Objects.md and go into OOC mode. You are quite limited in this mode, basically it works
like a simple chat program.  It acts as a staging area for switching between Characters (if your
game supports that) or as a safety mode if your Character gets deleted. Use <code>ic</code> to attempt to
(re)puppet a Character. </p>
<p>Note that the Account object can have, and often does have, a different set of
<a href="Locks#Permissions">Permissions</a> from the Character they control.  Normally you should put your
permissions on the Account level - this will overrule permissions set on the Character level. For
the permissions of the Character to come into play the default <code>quell</code> command can be used. This
allows for exploring the game using a different permission set (but you can't escalate your
permissions this way - for hierarchical permissions like <code>Builder</code>, <code>Admin</code> etc, the <em>lower</em> of the
permissions on the Character/Account will always be used). </p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-your-own-account-types">How to create your own Account types<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-create-your-own-account-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You will usually not want more than one Account typeclass for all new accounts (but you could in
principle create a system that changes an account's typeclass dynamically). </p>
<p>An Evennia Account is, per definition, a Python class that includes <code>evennia.DefaultAccount</code> among
its parents. In <code>mygame/typeclasses/accounts.py</code> there is an empty class ready for you to modify.
Evennia defaults to using this (it inherits directly from <code>DefaultAccount</code>). </p>
<p>Here's an example of modifying the default Account class in code: </p>
<pre><code class="python">    # in mygame/typeclasses/accounts.py

    from evennia import DefaultAccount

    class Account(DefaultAccount): # [...]

    at_account_creation(self): &quot;this is called only once, when account is first created&quot;
        self.db.real_name = None      # this is set later self.db.real_address = None   #       &quot;
        self.db.config_1 = True       # default config self.db.config_2 = False      #       &quot;
        self.db.config_3 = 1          #       &quot;

        # ... whatever else our game needs to know ``` Reload the server with `reload`. 

</code></pre>

<p>... However, if you use <code>examine *self</code> (the asterisk makes you examine your Account object rather
than your Character), you won't see your new Attributes yet. This is because <code>at_account_creation</code>
is only called the very <em>first</em> time the Account is called and your Account object already exists
(any new Accounts that connect will see them though). To update yourself you need to make sure to
re-fire the hook on all the Accounts you have already created. Here is an example of how to do this
using <code>py</code>:</p>
<p><code>py [account.at_account_creation() for account in evennia.managers.accounts.all()]</code></p>
<p>You should now see the Attributes on yourself. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you wanted Evennia to default to a completely <em>different</em> Account class located elsewhere, you
must point Evennia to it. Add <code>BASE_ACCOUNT_TYPECLASS</code> to your settings file, and give the python
path to your custom class as its value. By default this points to <code>typeclasses.accounts.Account</code>,
the empty template we used above.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="properties-on-accounts">Properties on Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-on-accounts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Beyond those properties assigned to all typeclassed objects (see <a href="Typeclasses.html">Typeclasses</a>), the
Account also has the following custom properties: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>user</code> - a unique link to a <code>User</code> Django object, representing the logged-in user.</li>
<li><code>obj</code> - an alias for <code>character</code>.</li>
<li><code>name</code> - an alias for <code>user.username</code></li>
<li><code>sessions</code> - an instance of
  <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/evennia.objects.objects#objectsessionhandler">ObjectSessionHandler</a>
  managing all connected Sessions (physical connections) this object listens to (Note: In older
  versions of Evennia, this was a list). The so-called <code>session-id</code> (used in many places) is found as
  a property <code>sessid</code> on each Session instance.</li>
<li><code>is_superuser</code> (bool: True/False) - if this account is a superuser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special handlers:
- <code>cmdset</code> - This holds all the current <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> of this Account. By default these are
  the commands found in the cmdset defined by <code>settings.CMDSET_ACCOUNT</code>.
- <code>nicks</code> - This stores and handles <a href="Nicks.html">Nicks</a>, in the same way as nicks it works on Objects.
  For Accounts, nicks are primarily used to store custom aliases for <a href="Communications#Channels">Channels</a>.</p>
<p>Selection of special methods (see <code>evennia.DefaultAccount</code> for details):
- <code>get_puppet</code> - get a currently puppeted object connected to the Account and a given session id, if
  any.
- <code>puppet_object</code> - connect a session to a puppetable Object.
- <code>unpuppet_object</code> - disconnect a session from a puppetable Object.
- <code>msg</code> - send text to the Account
- <code>execute_cmd</code> - runs a command as if this Account did it.
- <code>search</code> - search for Accounts.</p>
