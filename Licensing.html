    <p><a href="Tells-you-how-free-you-are-to-use-Evennia-to-your-personal-whims.-Really!"></a></p>
<p>Evennia is licensed under the very friendly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">BSD</a>
(3-clause) license.  You can find the license as
<a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">LICENSE.txt</a> in the Evennia
repository's root.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When creating a game using Evennia, what does the license permit me to do with it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It's your own game world to do with as you please! Keep it to yourself or re-distribute it
under another license of your choice - or sell it and become filthy rich for all we care.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have modified the Evennia library itself, what does the license say about that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Our license allows you to do whatever you want with your modified Evennia, including
re-distributing or selling it, as long as you include our license and copyright info found in
<code>LICENSE.txt</code> along with your distribution.</p>
<p>... Of course, if you fix bugs or add some new snazzy feature we <em>softly nudge</em> you to make those
changes available so they can be added to the core Evennia package for everyone's benefit. The
license doesn't <em>require</em> you to do it, but that doesn't mean we won't still greatly appreciate it
if you do!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I re-distribute the Evennia server package along with my custom game implementation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure. As long as the text in <code>LICENSE.txt</code> is included.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What about Contributions?</strong></p>
<p>The contributions in <code>evennia/evennia/contrib</code> are considered to be released under the same license
as Evennia itself, unless the individual contributor has specifically defined otherwise.</p>
