    <p>This is a whitepage for free discussion about the wiki docs and refactorings needed. </p>
<p>Note that this is not a forum. To keep things clean, each opinion text should ideally present a clear argument or lay out a suggestion. Asking for clarification and any side-discussions should be held in chat or forum.</p>

<p>This is how to make a discussion entry for the whitepage. Use any markdown formatting you need. Also remember to copy your work to the clipboard before saving the page since if someone else edited the page since you started, you'll have to reload and write again.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues/1431">This (now closed) issue by DamnedScholar</a> gives the following suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it would be useful for the pages that explain how to use various features of Evennia to have explicit and easily visible links to the respective API entry or entries. Some pages do, but not all. I imagine this as a single entry at the top of the page [...].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues/1578">This (now closed) issue by taladan</a> gives the following suggestion: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would help me (and probably a couple of others) if there is a way to show the file path where a particular thing exists. Maybe up under the 'last edited' line we could have a line like:
evennia/locks/lockhandler.py</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would help in development to quickly refer to where a resource is located.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Batch-code-processor">Batch Code</a> should have a link in the developer area. It is currently only listed in the tutorials section as an afterthought to a tutorial title.</p>
<hr />
<p>In regards to the general structure of each wiki page: I'd like to see a table of contents at the top of each one, so that it can be quickly navigated and is immediately apparent what sections are covered on the page. Similar to the current <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> page.</p>
<hr />
<p>The structuring of the page should also include a quick reference cheatsheet for certain aspects. Such as <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Tags">Tags</a> including a quick reference section at the top that lists an example of every available method you can use in a clear and consistent format, along with a comment. Readers shouldn't have to decipher the article to gather such basic information and it should instead be available at first glance.</p>
<p>Example of a quick reference:</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong></p>
<pre><code># Add a tag.
obj.tags.add(&quot;label&quot;)

# Remove a tag.
obj.tags.remove(&quot;label&quot;)

# Remove all tags.
obj.tags.clear()

# Search for a tag. Evennia must be imported first.
store_result = evennia.search_tag(&quot;label&quot;)

# Return a list of all tags.
obj.tags.all()  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Aliases</strong></p>
<pre><code># Add an alias.
obj.aliases.add(&quot;label&quot;)

ETC...
</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>In regards to comment structure, I often find that smushing together lines with comments to be too obscure. White space should be used to clearly delineate what information the comment is for. I understand that the current format is that a comment references whatever is below it, but newbies may not know that until they realize it.</p>
<p>Example of poor formatting:</p>
<pre><code>#comment
command/code
#comment
command/code
</code></pre>

<p>Example of good formatting:</p>
<pre><code># Comment.
command/code

# Comment.
command/code
</code></pre>
